## How It Works / My Contribution
This extension was conceptualized and guided using **GPT-4 prompting**:  
- Designed the **count-in workflow** and metronome functionality.  
- Added **tap tempo functionality** for flexible tempo adjustment.  
- Defined **user experience and timing mechanics** for smooth synchronization.  
- Suggested implementation approaches using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Conducted **testing across multiple videos and tempos** to ensure accurate timing and reliable performance.  

> Note: I guided the project conceptually using GPT-4; actual coding was implemented following the design prompts.
