AI-assisted design concept (extension functionality guided via prompts).

How It Works / My Contribution

This extension was conceptualized and guided using AI prompting:

Designed the count-in workflow and metronome functionality concept.

Defined user experience and timing mechanics for smooth synchronization.

Suggested implementation approaches using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Note: Development of code was guided by prompts; the main role was in conceptualization and AI-assisted design.
